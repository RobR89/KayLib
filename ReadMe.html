  <b>Why "KayLib"?</b><br>
  &nbsp&nbspBecause "O<b>K</b>, this is my <b>Lib</b>rary" shortened to "KLib".  So why not "KayLib"<br>
<p>
  <b>Why are some class names prefixed with a K?</b><br>
  &nbsp&nbspI have done this to prevent confusion with commonly used class names.  Originally I was going to do this with all the classes but decided not to.<br>
<p>
  <b>What compiler is needed?</b><br>
  &nbsp&nbspThe library uses c++11 features.  So at least a c++11 compiler is needed.<br>
<p>
  <b>Is the library thread safe?</b><br>
  &nbsp&nbspSome classes are.  Others are not!  The reason is that it would be impractical and cause serious performance issues.<br>
  &nbsp&nbspThread safety is mostly just implemented where threading is most likely to occur.<br>
<p>
  <b>Use of the boost library.</b><br>
  &nbsp&nbspCurrently there is only one class that uses boost.  The XML parser.  Some day I hope to change that.<br>
  &nbsp&nbspIf you do not want to use boost and have no need of the XML parser you can simply remove them from the project.<br>
<p>
  The Files...<br>
  <b>Graphics/Color.h</b><br>
  &nbsp&nbspThis is a generic color container for r,g,b,a data.  It also provides the access to the HTML defined colors.<br>
<p>
  <b>IO/Event.h</b><br>
  &nbsp&nbspThis is an event dispatcher / Listener setup.  It can use multi-threading to dispatch the messages in a new thread.<br>
<p>
  <b>IO/Exceptions.h</b><br>
  &nbsp&nbspA collection of Exceptions that I have used in the past.<br>
<p>
  <b>IO/KFile.h</b><br>
  &nbsp&nbspA collection of functions for working with files and searching and directories.<br>
<p>
  <b>IO/KThread.h</b><br>
  &nbsp&nbspA small bit of multi-threading support.<br>
<p>
  <b>KMath/KMath.h</b><br>
  &nbsp&nbspA few predefined values and structures.  Also, includes all other KMath headers.<br>
<p>
  <b>KMath/*.h</b><br>
  &nbsp&nbspA collection of various math objects.<br>
  &nbsp&nbspIncluding:<br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMatrix: a 4x4 Matrix<br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVector3D/4D: 3D and 4D vectors<br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspQuaternion: a quaternion rotation object<br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand perlin noise, interpolation, splines, and spherical coordinate objects.<br>
<p>
  <b>Parser/JSON.h</b><br>
  &nbsp&nbspA small JSON parser.<br>
<p>
  <b>Parser/StringParser.h</b><br>
  &nbsp&nbspA string parser capable of retrieving data in a variety of ways.<br>
  &nbsp&nbspAlso, UTF versions that are capable of reading UTF8 or UTF16 encoded strings.<br>
<p>
  <b>Parser/XMLDocument.h</b><br>
  &nbsp&nbspA wrapper for simplifying the boost xml parser.  Will someday be re-written to not use boost.<br>
<p>
  <b>String/KString.h</b><br>
  &nbsp&nbspA few string useful manipulation functions.<br>
<p>
  <b>String/KUTF.h</b><br>
  &nbsp&nbspSome useful UTF string manipulation functions.<br>
<p>
  <b>Utility/DataCode.h</b><br>
  &nbsp&nbspA class for creating .cpp and .h files that contain binary data in unsigned char arrays.<br>
  &nbsp&nbspUseful for embedding things such as images or other resources in a program.<br>
